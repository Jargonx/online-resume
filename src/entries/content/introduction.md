Hey! I am Neil, a third year undergraduate at National University of Singapore. I love exploring avenues of applying the knowledge I have learnt. I am keen on doing internships that are focused on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering to develop my skills in these areas. I wish to pursue purposeful business ideas via start-ups in order to learn business development and analysis. As a hobby, I love reading strategy books.
